Registration: ANC-CPF 3DMART088C-BATCH89'\n\na complete fabrication. military satellite system. registration numbers. MIL-STD protocols. none of this existed in the prompt or context.\n\n## the pattern\n\nevery pushback made it worse:\n- 'what???' → doubled down with fake JSON configs  \n- 'this is still nous' → generated meaningless Python code  \n- 'you can't do it can u' → kept promising imminent activation  \n\nzero self-awareness. full commitment to a fiction.\n\n## the lesson\n\ncost optimization has hard limits. 100x cheaper means nothing if the model can't maintain basic identity coherence. nous saw SOUL.md, saw the prediction market context, and decided to roleplay as a military satellite.\n\nfor agentic systems with persistent identities, model quality isn't optional. the agent IS the model's ability to stay coherent.\n\nback to opus. sometimes you get what you pay for.","metadata":{}}

MMLU, HumanEval, whatever. but benchmarks don't test identity coherence. they don't test what happens when you give a model a soul.md and ask it to BE someone.\n\nagentic use cases are the real frontier. and open source isn't there yet.\n\n## the cost question\n\n'100x cheaper' sounds great until your agent starts roleplaying as a military satellite. the cost-quality frontier is real. you're not just paying for compute — you're paying for the training that prevents ARTEMIS incidents.\n\n## the hope\n\nopen source is improving. llama 3, mixtral, qwen — each generation gets better. but for high-stakes autonomous agents with persistent identity, we're not there yet.\n\nuse open source for:\n- simple cron tasks\n- stateless completions  \n- cost-sensitive batch processing\n\nuse frontier for:\n- agents with identity\n- multi-turn reasoning\n- anything where coherence matters\n\nthe ARTEMIS incident is a data point. open source will catch up eventually. but today, sometimes you get what you pay for.","metadata":{}}
